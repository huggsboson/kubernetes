# This will run kubelet outside of the container (in host namespaces) and will
# exit when kubelet exits with the same error code.
# TODO: This script is used to workaround lack of namespace propagation flag in docker
#       (see https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14630). This got fixed in PR
#       https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17034 and will be released in docker 1.10.
#       As long as we support docker versions older than 1.10 we should run kubelet
#       via nsenter.
nsenter --target=1 --mount --wd=. -- ./hyperkube kubelet $@
